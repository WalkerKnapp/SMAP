Determines intensity around a localization by a regression 
of a Gaussian model with fixed positions and sigma. 
Either amplitude and background or only the amplitude are fitting parameters.

gui:Parameters:
gui:fitonbg If checked, the background is subtracted before fitting. You need to check calculate BG above.
gui:fixpsf If checkedc, the PSF size is fixed to this value, otherwise the fitted
PSF size (PSFxpix, PSFypix) is used.
gui:psfsize_fit Size of the PSF
gui:roisize_fit Size of the ROI used for fitting
gui:t1=roisize_fit
