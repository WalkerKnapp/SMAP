Grouping: 

This functionality groups (merges) localizations in consecutive frames 
corresponding to the same fluorophore activation event into a single localization.

Coordinates are calculated as the weighted mean as e.g. $x_m=\sum_i x_i w_i / \sum w_i$. 
The weights are given by $w_i=1/\sigma_i^2$. $\sigma_i$ is the localization precision.

Errors (e.g. locaization precisions) are averaged as $\sigma_m=(\sum_i 1/\sigma_i^2)^{-1/2}$

dT specifies how many frames a fluorophore can be in the dark state to be counted 
for the same localizaton. dX specifies the spatial search radius. It can be fix,
or calculated from the lcoalization precisions of the localizations to be merged.
Here, localizations are still merged if $dx^2< 2.5(\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2)$, with $dx$ the
displacement and $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ the localization precison of both localizations.
