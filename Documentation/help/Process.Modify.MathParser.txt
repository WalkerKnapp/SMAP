Perfrom complex calculations on localization fields (attributes). 
Equations using matlab functions are parsed. Previous calculations are saved for quick access.

Use the field names directly as variables. Don't forget to use vector notation (e.g. ".*", "./", ".^").

gui:Parameters:
gui:dataselect Choose localization file data set.
gui:dataselect_all Perfrom calculations on localizations in all opened files.
gui:equation Type in the equation using MATLAB (vector) notation and localization fields as variables
gui:equationh Choose an equation you used previously.
gui:resultfield Assign result of the calculation to this field
gui:resultfieldh Assign result of the calculation to this previously saved field
gui:t1 
gui:t2
gui:t3
