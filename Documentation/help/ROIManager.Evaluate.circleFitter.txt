Fits circular model to localizations in the ROI to determine the radius and 
center coordinates of circular structures. 

The basis are the filtered localizaitons as defined in the Render tab.

Two modes are implemented:

\textbf{Circle:} Fits a circle (with center coordinates $x_0$, $y_0$ and radius $R$)
to the coordinates of the localization $x_i$, $y_i$ by minimizing:

$$ \sum_i \left(\sqrt{(x_i-x_0)^2+(y_i-y_0)^2}-R \right)^2$$

\textbf{Ring:} Fits a ring (with center coordinates $x_0$, $y_0$, outer radius $R_o$,
thickness of the ring of $d_r$ and localization uncertainty $\sigma$) to the 
localizations. 

For this, the localizations are rendered as a superresolution 
image representing each localization as a Gaussian with a standard deviation 
proportional 
to the localization precsion (set the proportionality factor in the render par
field in the Render tab). 

The fitting model is also image based and consists of the ring filtered with a Gaussian
kernel with a standard deviation given by $\sigma$.

A non-linear least-squares fit is employed to fit the image-based model to the data.

gui:Parameters:
gui:fit_sigma Treat the stabdard deviation of the Gaussian filter of the model as a free fit parameter.
gui:gaussfac_imfit Additional blurring of the superresolution image by this factor. For several layers, 
you can define one factor per layer using vector notation.
gui:gaussfac_imfitt=gaussfac_imfit
gui:sqrtfit If checked, fit the square root of the superresolution image instead of the image 
itself. This can be useful, as it reduces the impact of repeated localizations. Also
in a histogram the values follow Poisson statistics, thus this normalization reduces the weight of 
high values with large variance.
