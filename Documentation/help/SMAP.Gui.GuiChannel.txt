GUI to control render options.

You can define several layers, each layer is rendered separately and a composite image of all layers is shown. You can add additional
layers by clicking the \bf + \rm tab.

In this GUI you can select the mode how to render, the color and contrasting options and you have quick access to the
most commonly used filters on the localizations (e.g. localization precision, z range, PSF size, number of frames.

Parameters that control the overall render appearence independent of the layer 
(e.g. pixel size of the rendered image) can be changed in the format panel on the top right 
of the SMAP GUI.

Many Plugins read out the settings here (includinding filters) and perform their 
analysis only on the localizations that are rendered in the different layers.

gui:Parameters:
gui:PSFxnm_max Filter on the size of the PSF (e.g. after using a free Gauss fit). This allows 
rejecting localizations that are far away from the foucs
and results in sectioning. 
gui:PSFxnm_min=PSFxnm_max
gui:PSFxnmb=PSFxnm_max 
gui:ch_filelist which file to display. When displaying images (e.g. tiff files that 
were attached to a file) select the corresponding localization file here.
gui:channels Channels (e.g. colors) to display. Use a b c or a:c notation to display more than one channel.
gui:colorauto Automatically set color range when a field for color coding is selected. Uncheck to keep this constant.
gui:colorfield_max Range of values to fill the lookup table (LUT). Usually 0 and 1. You can select a smaller range,
then values outside are fixed at the extreme or removed if restrict is checked. Or use a larger range to only
map parts of the LUT to the data.
 If fields (or z) are used for color coding: range of these values mapped to LUT.
gui:colorfield_min=colorfield_max 
gui:colorfieldb=colorfield_max
gui:colortxt Color coding of the image. normal: intensity coded, z: z color coded, 
 param: select field which to color code
gui:copyalllayers_button Copy these parameters to all layers
gui:default_button Reset to default parameters. 
gui:defaultsave_button Save default parameters. 
gui:externalrender External renderer. 
gui:filelistfilter If checked, only localizations in the file in the field to the left is displayed. 
Otherwise, all files are displayed in this layer.
gui:filtertxt Quick access to filter on the most important localization attributes. Specify minimum and maximum of the values.
gui:frame_max Filter on the frames. Allows to reject parts of th data with too dense localizations (beginning) or to filter out parts with large drifts. 
gui:frame_min=frame_max
gui:frameb=frame_max
gui:groupcheck If checked use grouped (merged) localizations. If unchecked, use ungrouped localizations.
gui:imax_max 
gui:imax_min absolut intensity or 
 quantile of the pixels that are not saturated (0<q<1, typically 0.999) or  
 v for q=1-10^(v), v<0, typically -3.5
gui:imaxb Contrast
gui:imaxtoggle toggle absolute intensity maximum (Imax) or quantile
gui:intensitycoding How to normalize every localization: \n normal: Integral=1,\n 
photons: total photons,\n 
blinks: number of localizations that were grouped/merged together, only use when display grouped localizstions.\n
√photons: square root of photones. Due to Poisson statistics on photons, this normalizes to the noise.\n
√blinks: square root grouped/merged localizatiosn. This normalizes to the noise.

gui:intensitytxt How to normalize every localization: normal: Integral=1, photons: total photons, blinks: number of connected localizations
gui:layercheck switch layer on and off
gui:locprecnm_max Filter on the  x,y localization precision 
gui:locprecnm_min=locprecnm_max 
gui:locprecnmb=locprecnm_max
gui:locprecznm_max Filter on the z localization precision 
gui:locprecznm_min=locprecznm_max
gui:locprecznmb=locprecznm_max 
gui:lut Select the color lookup table
gui:lutinv if checked: invert the colormap. If a field value is used for color-coding: invert the direction of mapping the LUT.
gui:luttxt=lut 
gui:parbutton Additional render paramters such as the proportionality constant for Gaussian rendering or parameters for external Renderers.
gui:remout if checked: remove loclizations outside LUT. 
 If unchecked: set them to maximum color.
gui:render_colormode Use how to apply color coding. \n normal: intensity coded, \n z: z color coded, 
 \n field: select a localization field (attribute) to use for color coding.
gui:renderfield field to color code
gui:rendermode How to render the image. \n Hist: as a histogram counting the number of localizations that fall in a pixel \n
Gauss: Render each localization as a Gaussian with a size  proportional to the localization precision \n
constGauss: render as Gaussian with a fixed size, specify the size here. \n
DL: Render as a diffraction limited image, using the camera pixel size and the fitted PSF size as a size for the Gaussian kernel.\n
tiff: Render attached tiff file. Select the tiff file below.\n
raw: Render raw camera files that were saved with the localization data file.
Other: use an external renderer (to the right).

gui:renderparameter numeric parameter for renderer. constGauss: size of Gauss (nm). Leave empty for automatic size determination
gui:rendertxt=rendermode
gui:shiftxy_max Shift reconstructed image by this value (nm). Useful to correct for chromatic aberrations.
gui:shiftxy_min Shift=shiftxy_max 
gui:shiftxy_z Shift=shiftxy_max  
gui:shiftxyb=shiftxy_max  
gui:text1=channels 
gui:tiftxt Select which image to display
gui:znm_max z range to display 
gui:znm_min=znm_max 
gui:znmb=znm_max 

gui:LLrelb Filter on normalized (relative) Log Likelihood. The Log Likelihood is a measure for the goodness of fit. You can use 
this filter to remove poorly localizied localizations, for instance due to nearby activation of another fluorophore.
gui:LLrel_min=LLrelb
gui:LLrel_max=LLrelb
