Loads raw camera images (single file or direcotry with single images). 
These can be tiff files, but also any OME compatible image files. 
This plugin can load and process images during acquisition for online fitting. 
With the help of the CameraManager the metadata is parsed and passed on to the CameraConverter.

gui:Parameters:
gui:framestart First frame to analyze. Typically 1, unless the first frames are too dense to be localized.
gui:framestop Last frame to analyze. Is set from the metadata upon loading of the file, but can be overwritten if you want to 
fit only a subset of the data.
gui:ismultifile For global fitting of data that are acquired with two different cameras.
gui:loaderclass Which loader to use for image loading: \n
auto: Tries to find the correct loader based on the extension and availability of meta data. \n
MMStack: Micro-manager stack file, this uses a micro-manager java class for loading and extraction of meta data. \n
MMSingle: Data saved by Micro-manager as single image files. Parses meta data. \n
OME: The MATLAB OME image loader. For this to work, the bioformats package needs to be installed and the path defined in the SMAP/Preferences.\n
simpleTif: A simple loader for tiff stacks. Does not extract camera meta data. Used when none of the above work.
gui:loadtifbutton Load raw camera image tif files. Either single images in directory. Or multi-image Tiff stacks. For data 
saved in several files (big micro-manager tiff stacks or data saved as single tiff files) you can select any part file of the data.
gui:onlineanalysis Fit during acquisition. If checked, max frames is ignored. Waits until no more images are written to the file / directory.
gui:onlineanalysiswaittime Waiting time for online analysis. Typically a few secods.
gui:textf Range of frames used for fitting.
gui:tiffile Path to raw camarea data.
