Assigns identity (color) to localizations based on intensities in both 
camerachannels. For this, for all localizations their intensity in camera channel 1
is plotted against their intensity in camera channel 2.

In the resulting plot, the user defines polynomial regions for each color.

The color number is then saved in the channel field of the localizations. 
Localizatons outside the regions have a color number of 0.

ROIs can be saved for later use. ROIs saved in settings/temp/AssignColorRois.mat
are automatically loaded.

gui:Parameters:
gui:assignfield1 field that carries information for channel 1 (reference)
gui:assignfield2 field that carries information for channel 2 (target)
gui:ch1roi Define ROI for color 1 in the intensity plot
gui:ch1t=ch1roi
gui:ch2roi Define ROI for color 2 in the intensity plot
gui:ch2t=ch2roi
gui:chN Define ROI for an additional color in the intensity plot. Define 
the number of the channel here.
gui:chNroi Number of the additional color number.

gui:deleterois Delete previously drawn ROIs
gui:loadbutton Load ROIs that were saved previously
gui:logscale Display the intensity plot with a logarithmic scale. This helps in
better visualizing the amount of overlap (cross-talk) among the colors.
gui:savebutton Save current ROIs to be used later
gui:setdefault Look for fields in the localizaton attributes that contain
dual-channel intensity information.
gui:showrois Show currently selected ROIs.
gui:t1 
gui:usegrouped Plot the intensities based on grouped localizations
