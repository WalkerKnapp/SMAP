 Evaluates properties of the structure (number of localizations, size of radius of ring, localizations inside or outside of ring,
 to determine if an 
automatically segmented structure resembles a nuclear pore complex. Used to clean up automatic segmentation. 

This sets the 'use' property. You can then sort according to this property and remove localizations.

gui:Parameters:
gui:R Radius of the NPC (nm)
gui:Rt=R
gui:center If checked, the NPC is autmatically centered based on a circle fit. 
gui:dR Thickness of a rim in which we expect localizations (nm):
gui:dRt=dR 
gui:inside Cutoff based on numbers of localizations inside the ring compared to the localizations on the ring. To filter out clusters that are not ring-like.
gui:insidet=inside 
gui:maxPSF Maximum of the average size of the fitted PSF (for 2D Gaussian fitting). Used to filter out NPCs that are not in focus.
gui:maxPSFt=maxPSF 
gui:minlocs Minimum number of localizations. To filter out small background clusters.
gui:minlocst=minlocs
gui:minsize Minimum size of the structure (nm, related to standard deviation). To filter out small background clusters.
gui:minsizet=minsize 
gui:outside Cutoff based on numbers of localizations outside the ring compared to the localizations on the ring. To filter out clusters that have a huge background.
gui:outsidet=outside 
gui:radiusrange Range of allowed radii based on a circle fit to the coordinates.
gui:radiusranget=radiusrange
