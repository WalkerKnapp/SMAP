Calculates shift between rendered images in 
two layers. The resulting shift is written into the shift field 
in the layer tab of the target layer.
Adjust the pixel size and FoV so that the shift can be calculated 
from the reconstructed image.
The transformation can also be saved for later use with Apply Transform.

Algorithm: The images are cross-correlated and the maximum of the cross-correlatio
is dertermined with sub-pixel accuracy

gui:Parameters:
gui:Tfile File to save the transformation in
gui:correctcoordinates If this is selected, the shift is not written into the Layer tab field, 
but instead the xnm and ynm coordinates of the localizations are 
shifted by this value.
gui:dataselect Choose localization file data set to perform registration on
gui:pixelsize Size of a pixel in the reconstructed image 
gui:refselect Layer that contains reference localizations
gui:savebutton Save the transformation
gui:setpixelsize If selected, the pixel size given here is used for reconstruction
before cross-correlation.
gui:targetchannels When correct coordinates is selected, only localizations in this channel
are shifted. Pass on a several values to correct localizations with different channel values.
