Calculates profiles along a linear ROI and fits it with a model of choice. All results in nm.

Gauss: Fit with Gaussian. Results: sigma of the Gaussian and FWHM (directly measured 
as distance of first to the last data point above half the maximum value).

Flat: step function convolved with Gaussian (=Erf). Result FWHM as defined for the Gauss fit, 
the step length and the sigma of the Gaussian used for convulution.

Disk: Projection of a homogeneously filled disk, convolved with Gaussian. FWHM as defined for the Gauss fit. Disk R: Radius of the disk. Sigma: sigma of the Gaussian used for convolution.

Ring: As for the disk, but for the projection of a ring (e.g. for side views on microtubules or other ring-like structures). 

Distance: Fit with a double Gaussian with the same sigma. FWHM as defined for the Gauss fit, Distance d: distance between the maxima of the two Gaussians.

The convolution with a Gaussian can also be fixed to the average localization precision.

gui:linelength This overrides the length of the ROI and uses a well-defined ROI. Useful for direct comparison.
gui:linelengthcheck This overrides the length of the ROI and uses a well-defined ROI. Useful for direct comparison.
gui:restrictsigma If checked, the sigma of the Gaussian used for convulution is not fitted, but the average localization precision is used instead.
gui:setbinwidth Binwidth for profiles. If not checked, use pixel size of reconstruction
