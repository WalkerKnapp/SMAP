Calculates spatial statistics based on pair correlation and Ripleys K function. 

The pair correlation g(r) can counts the number of localizations in a ring of radius r around each localization and averages over all localizations.

Ripley's R(r) counts the number of localizations in a circle of radius r around each localization and averages over all localizations. It is the cumulative
distribution of the pair correlation function.

For Ripley's analysis, usually L(r)-r with L(r)=sqrt(R(r)/\pi) is plottet. 

For clustered localizations, L(r)-r is above 1, and the position of the maximum is related to the cluster size.

For pair correlation functions, the decay is related to the cluster size.

Pair correlation functions are calculated according to: Sengupta et al, "Probing Protein Heterogeneity"  
Nature Methods 8 (2011) as correlations using reconstructed images and Fourier Transforms.

Here, the analysis is extended also to two colors displayed in two layers to investigate co-clustering.

gui:Parameters:
gui:ch1 Layer that shows localizations of color 1
gui:ch1t=ch1 
gui:ch2 Layer that shows localizations of color 2. Choose none if you want to analyze a single color only.
gui:ch2t=ch2 
gui:rpix Pixel size (in nm) for calculating pair correlation curves (usually a few nm). 
gui:rpixt=rpix 
gui:rrange Range (in nm) for which the curves are calculates (large than the cluster size, typically a few 1000 nm).
