Annotate individual ROIs. You can define four lists (by loading a text file, see 
settings/parlistdefault.txt for the format) and select values for each of the lists.

You can select the previous ROI with the leftarrow key, and the next ROI with the rightarrow key.

You can focus on the previous list with shift-leftarrow and the next list with shift-rightarrow.

Then use up-arrow and down-arrow to select the list entry.

In addition, you can define two additonal line ROIs (with <> you can change the direction of the lines) and 
a free ROI.

Finally, you can change the 'use' property of a site that denotes if the site should be used
for further analysis. You can change this switch also in the ROImanager GUI above the ROI list.

In the List of ROIs (ROImanager GUI) you find the selected entries of the four lists after L, and the status of use in the end (+: used, -: not used).
