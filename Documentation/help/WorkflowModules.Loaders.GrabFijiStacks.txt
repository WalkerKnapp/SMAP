Opens an instance of Fiji in which you can open any image stack (if large, use virtual stack). 
This image stack can then be selected in the GUI and used for fitting.
You need to install Fiji, add the ImageJ-MATLAB plugin as described here:
https://imagej.net/MATLAB_Scripting#Running_ImageJ_within_MATLAB
and set the path to fiji in SMAP/Preferences.

Currently, an incompatibility between Fiji and Matlab might prevent function. I am working on getting this to run again. Any help highly appreciated.

gui:Parameters:
gui:fijibutton Opens a Fiji instance. In that, you can open the image stack as a virtual stack.
gui:filelist Lists the open Fiji windows. 
gui:fitall Fit data in all open Fiji windows
gui:framestart First frame to fit
gui:framestop Last frame to fit
gui:locdata_empty Empty localization data before fitting. Important if post-processing (eg drift correction) is perfromed as part of workflow
gui:refreshfiles Refresh the file list after opening files in Fiji
gui:text 
gui:textf Range of frames to fit
