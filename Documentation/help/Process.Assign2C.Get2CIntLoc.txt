Get2CIntLoc gets intensities corresponding localizations in two channels.

Algorithm: The transformation is used to transform the localizations
in the target channel back to the reference channel. In each frame, reference and 
target localizations are paired based on their proximity (closer together than 100 nm).
Each localization is then assigned an additional property with the intensity of 
the linked localization in the other channel. 

Unpaired localizations have an intensity of zero assigned for their partner.

After this, use Intensity2ManyChannels to assign a color from the intensity 
values.
