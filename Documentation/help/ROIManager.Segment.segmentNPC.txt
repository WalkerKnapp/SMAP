gui:Parameters:
gui:cutoff Relative cutoff in the filtered image. Adjust to segment NPCs, but not background localizations.
gui:diameterNPC Diameter of the NPC in nm
gui:getmask If selected, you can draw a ROI, only NPCs within that ROI are then segmented.
gui:rim Thickness of the rim of the circular filter in nam
gui:saveon Of not checked, NPCs are not added to the ROI manager (useful for testing the cutoff parameter). To save NPCs, check this.
gui:t1=cutoff 
gui:t3=diameterNPC
gui:t4=rim
