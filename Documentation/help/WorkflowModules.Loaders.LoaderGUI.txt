gui:Interpreter:none
Intermediate GUI to select a loader.

a. TifLoaderLoads raw camera images (single file or direcotry with single images). 
These can be tiff, files, but also any OME compatible image files. This plugin can load and process images during acquisition 
for online fitting. With the help of the CameraManager metadata is parsed and passed on to the CameraConverter.

b. TifLoaderParallelLoads tiff files. Can load single tiff files or tiff stacks, also while they are written. 
It also tries to locate the metadata.txt file from micromanger and passes it on to the camera converter. 

c. GrabFijiStacksOpens an instance of Fiji in which you can open any image stack (if large, use virtual stack). 
This image stack can then be selected in the GUI and used for fitting.

d. SimulateCameraImagesPlugin to simulate camera raw frames using a realistic fluorophore blinking model, PSF model  
and camera noise model. Useful to test fitting workflows.'
