Determines intensity around a localization by 
a) regression of an experimental PSF model 
(amplitude and background or only the amplitude free fitting), 
or b) by multipliation with an experimental PSF model.

gui:Parameters:
gui:bgsetvalue Background value for fixed background (select "Background fixed to" above).
gui:cal_3Dfile File containing a 3D bead calibration.
gui:fitbg Select how to treat the background. \n
"BG free fit" treats the background as a free fit parameter. \n
"BG from localizations" uses the bg from the localization field, determined previously
by single-molecule fitting. \n
"Background calculated above" uses quantile-filtered background. Make sure to check "calculate BG" above.\n
"BG fixed to" fixes the background. Specify the value.
gui:fitmode "fit": fit the experimental PSF to the image using a linear regression with
the intensity (and optional the background) as a free fit parameter. "multiply" multiply 
experimental PSF with the image and sum over all values.
gui:fixz0 Fix the z-position to specific value. 
gui:loadcal_3Dfile Load the 3D calibration file
gui:normalizeimage Normalize the image prior to fitting to shot noise. Essentially using 
the square root of the photon intensity values.
gui:roisize_fit Roi size for fitting
gui:t1 
gui:z0 Fixed z-position used for fitting.
